# Elevate_JavaInternship-TASK-6

This project is a To-Do List desktop application created with Java Swing.

 To put it briefly:

 The objective is to develop an interactive, visual window for managing a to-do list.

 Important Elements: It makes use of Java Swing classes, such as JFrame (the window), JTextField (where you type the task), JList (which shows the tasks), and JButton (which initiates the "Add" and "Delete" actions).

 Key Ideas: The project teaches Event Handling (using the ActionListener to make buttons actually do something when clicked), Layout Managers (how to arrange components neatly), and GUI development.
